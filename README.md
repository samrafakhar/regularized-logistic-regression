# regularized-logistic-regression
In this exercise, a logistic regression model to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant pass quality assurance(QA) will be created step by step.
The details of this assignment is described in ex2.pdf

## Visualizing the Data

## Learning Parameters and Plotting
gradient descent is implemented to find optimal parameters. 
Using final theta value to plot the decision boundary on the training data and then we try different regularization parameters.
